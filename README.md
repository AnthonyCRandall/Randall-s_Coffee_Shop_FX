## â˜• Welcome to Randall's Coffee Shop!

This JavaFX application, created as part of a school project with limited time, contains the core functionality needed for a user to order a caffeinated drink of their choice. This application allows for a user to order different types of drinks,
customize them, add any danishes of their liking (if they choose), and calculates the total cost (including tax of course). It's important to note that in my project I mainly focuses on functionality, the UI 
is still a work in progress and will be adjusted in future versions.

The purpose of this project was to build a single-page interactive application that simulates a shop of some sort. I prioritize developing a robust, easy to use GUI that demonstrates my ability to learn and have fun with JavaFX.

### Features:

- Landing Page: The page that a user is greeted with after running the application.
- Menu Page: Displays a list of beverages availanle for selection at my shop. Users can select from coffee, tea, blended drinks, etc.
- Drink Customization Pages: Each page will eventually have its own page for customization (the blended beverages page is the only one that has it for now). Users can tinker with options such as the size, type of milk, and any add-ons.
- Checkout Page: Once the user selects what they want, they can confirm their order, and the application will calculate the total price based on selections.
- Page Jumping: The user can bounce back and forth between pages at any time if needed.

 ### Future Additions:

 While the main functionality is just about complete for this version, the UI is still a work in progress. I plan to include...
 - UI Enhancements: A more aesthetic and polished interface with a better layout for each pages objects.
 - Error Handling: More robust error handling for user selections (for ex. not allowing the user to leave the blended beverages page before selecting a milk of their choice).
 - Addition Features: More options for drink customization, a display on the checkout page to show the users order, a payment page etc.

### Technology Used:

- BlueJ: An IDE for Java.
- JavaFX: Used for developing a GUI.
- CSS: For styling and customizing components.
